            <h2>photography experience</h2>
            <p>With over 5years of professional photography experience, I specialize in capturing timeless and authentic moments across a variety of genres, including weddings, portraits, family sessions, events, and commercial photography. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with a diverse range of clients‚Äîfrom individuals and families to local brands and small businesses‚Äîdelivering over large number of successful shoots. I continually refine my craft through ongoing training in studio lighting, editing, and creative direction. Whether I'm shooting in natural light or a controlled studio environment, my approach is grounded in storytelling, emotion, and attention to detail. From the first consultation to final delivery, I aim to create a comfortable, collaborative experience that results in images my clients truly love.</p>
